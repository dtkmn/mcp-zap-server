### Added

- Expose OWASP ZAP actions (spider, active scan, import OpenAPI specs, HTML/JSON report generation) as MCP tools in a Spring Boot application.

- Eliminate manual CLI calls by integrating ZAP with MCP-compatible AI agents (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf).

- Support remote OpenAPI specification import into ZAP for automated scanning workflows.

- Docker Compose orchestration for ZAP, MCP server, MCP File System, Open Web-UI, Juice Shop, and Swagger Petstore services.

- Secure configuration using ZAP_API_KEY and MCP_API_KEY environment variables.

- Provide both STDIO (-Dspring.ai.mcp.server.stdio=true) and HTTP SSE transport modes for MCP communication.

- Offer Web UI panels to configure OpenAI/Ollama API connections and MCP server endpoints.

- Include prompt examples for orchestrating ZAP scans and retrieving scan results via any MCP-compatible AI agent.

- Manual build support via Gradle (./gradlew clean build) and log management commands (docker-compose logs -f).
