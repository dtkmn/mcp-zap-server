## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have discovered a security issue, **please do NOT open a public GitHub issue**. Instead, follow these steps:

1. **Email**: Send the details to **danieltse@gmail.com**.
2. **Details to include**:
    - Affected version(s) (e.g. `0.1.0-SNAPSHOT` or `0.1.0`).
    - Clear description of the vulnerability and its impact.
    - Steps to reproduce, including code snippets or commands if possible.
    - Suggested fix or mitigation, if you have one.

We aim to:
- Acknowledge receipt within **2 business days**.
- Provide a fix or mitigation plan within **14 calendar days** of acknowledgment.
- Publicly disclose the vulnerability and credit the reporter **after** a fix is released, unless otherwise requested.

## Scope

This policy covers all code in this repository, including:

- Spring Boot application code
- Docker Compose configurations
- CI/CD and build scripts
- Any auxiliary scripts or utilities provided here

## Handling a Report

1. **Confirmation**: We’ll confirm receipt by email and may request additional information.
2. **Investigation**: We’ll reproduce and assess the severity.
3. **Remediation**: We’ll develop, test, and release a patch.
4. **Disclosure**: We’ll coordinate public disclosure and release notes, crediting contributors as agreed.
